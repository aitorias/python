# Comparison operators

The following examples demonstrate how to use comparison operators with the data types int (integers, whole numbers) and float (number with a decimal point or fractional value). Comparison operators return Boolean results. As you learned previously, Boolean is a data type that can hold only one of two values: True or False.

The comparison operators include:

- == (equality)
- != (not equal to)
- \> (greater than)
- < (less than)
- \>= (greater than or equal to)
- <= (less than or equal to)

| Symbol | Name                              | Expression | Description                     |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| ==     | Equality operator                 | a == b     | a is equal to b                 |
| !=     | Not equal to operator             | a != b     | a is not equal to b             |
| >      | Greater than operator             | a > b      | a is larger than b              |
| >=     | Greater than or equal to operator | a >= b     | a is larger than or equal to b  |
| <      | Less than operator                | a < b      | a is smaller than b             |
| <=     | Less than or equal to operator    | a <= b     | a is smaller than or equal to b |

| Expression        | Description                                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| a == a and a != b | True if both sides are True, otherwise False.                   |
| a > b or a <= c   | True if either side is True. False if both sides are False.     |
| not a == b        | True if the statement is False, False if the statement is True. |
