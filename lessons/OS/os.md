# Operating system (OS)

The operating system (OS) is the software that manages everything that goes on in the computer. It reads, writes and deletes files, how the processes start, how they interact with each other and how they finish.

It has two main parts: the kernel and the user space.

## Kernel

The kernel is the main core of an Operating System. It talks directy to the hardware and manages the systems resources. Users cannot interact with the kernel directly. Instead, the users interacts with the user space.

## User space

The user space is everything outside the kernel and the things that the users interacts with directly, like the system programs and user interface.
