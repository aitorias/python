# Types of languages

## Compiled languages

Compiled languages needs a software called compiler that translates the code into machinge level language for the computer to understand and execute the program. Compiled programs are fast to run but a bit slow to compile itself.

Examples:

- C
- C++
- GO
- Rust

## Interpreted languages

Interpreted languages needs a software called interpreter to execute the instructions specified in the code rather than running them through a compiler first.
The development cycle for a interpreted program is faster than the compiled ones and the same code can be red on different operating systems.

Interpreted langauges are slower than compiled ones when running.

Examples:

- Python
- Ruby
- JavaScript
- Bash
- PowerShell

## Intermediate languages

These languages are a mix of the two above. The code needs to be compiled first, but into intermediate code instead of machine language, that means that is compiled in supportable code that can execute on different platforms.

Examples:

- C#
- Java
