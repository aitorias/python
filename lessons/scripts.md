# Scripts

## Permissions

To change the file permissions there is a commnd called _chmod_. It can change the read, write and execute permissions of a file.

Example:

```bash
chmod -r file.py
chmod -w file.py
chmod -x file.py
```

# Shebang

Shebang specifies beforehand what command to use to execute or when running the script.

Example:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
print("Hello World!")
```
